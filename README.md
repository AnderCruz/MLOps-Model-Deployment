# 🚀 MLOps: Model Deployment

This project demonstrates how to **deploy machine learning models** in production environments using **Flask, Docker, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and GitHub Actions**.

Developed by **Nowa Analytics**, a consultancy specialized in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and MLOps solutions**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to learn how to:

* Make machine learning models accessible via APIs
* Deploy models using **Flask** and **Google Cloud Platform**
* Package and distribute applications with **Docker**
* Automate continuous deployment with **GitHub Actions**

By the end of this project, you will have a **production-ready deployment pipeline** for serving ML models.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 🔹 1. Project Setup

* Install **Cookiecutter** to follow community-driven data science repository standards
* Structure a **Data Science + Flask** project
* Create a **GitHub repository** and upload project files

### 🔹 2. Model Serving with Flask on GCP

* Create a **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** account
* Launch a server on **Google Compute Engine**
* Configure and run a Flask server
* Open **Firewall rules** to allow HTTP requests
* Serve your ML model on a remote server

### 🔹 3. Containerization with Docker

* Write a `Dockerfile`
* Configure **environment variables** in Docker
* Build Docker containers
* Push images to **Google Container Registry**
* Deploy containers to **Google Cloud Run**

### 🔹 4. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

* Create a **GitHub Actions YAML pipeline**
* Integrate with **Google Cloud Run**
* Create and configure a **Service Account**
* Store secrets in **GitHub Actions**
* Enable **continuous delivery pipeline** for automatic deployments
